# Olympic Analysis
Olympic Analysis is a project aimed at analyzing historical data from the Olympic Games to gain insights into athlete performance, medal counts, trends over time, and other relevant metrics. The project utilizes data analysis techniques, visualization tools, and statistical analysis to explore and understand the rich history of the Olympic Games.

# Introduction
The Olympic Analysis project leverages historical data from various Olympic Games to answer questions such as:

Which countries have won the most medals in the history of the Olympics?
How has the performance of different countries evolved over time?
What are the most successful sports and athletes in Olympic history?
Are there any trends or patterns in medal distribution, gender participation, or host country performance?
# Technologies Used
**Python:** The project is implemented in Python, a versatile programming language commonly used for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning.

**Pandas:** Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library in Python used for processing and analyzing Olympic data.

**Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Matplotlib and Seaborn are plotting libraries in Python used for creating visualizations such as line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, and more.
Plotly: Plotly is a graphing library in Python used for creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.

**Jupyter Notebook:** Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment used for data analysis, visualization, and sharing code.
NumPy: NumPy is a numerical computing library in Python used for performing mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
Data Sources
The Olympic Analysis project relies on historical data from the following sources:

**Olympic.org:** The official website of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) provides comprehensive data on past Olympic Games, including information about athletes, events, medal counts, and more.

**Analysis Techniques**
The Olympic Analysis project involves the following analysis techniques:

**Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate summary statistics such as mean, median, standard deviation, etc., to describe the distribution of data.

**Visualization:** Create visualizations such as bar charts, line plots, heatmaps, and pie charts to explore trends and patterns in the data.

## Deployment

To deploy this project run

```bash
  streamlit app.run
```


## Run Locally

Sample code

```bash
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load Olympic data into a DataFrame
olympic_data = pd.read_csv("olympic_data.csv")

# Preprocess the data (clean missing values, handle outliers, etc.)

# Analyze medal counts by country
medal_counts = olympic_data.groupby("Country")["Medals"].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)

# Plot top 10 countries by medal counts
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
medal_counts.plot(kind="bar", color="skyblue")
plt.title("Top 10 Countries by Olympic Medal Counts")
plt.xlabel("Country")
plt.ylabel("Total Medals")
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.show()

```
